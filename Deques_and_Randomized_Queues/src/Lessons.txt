I've made a great deal of mistakes while working on this project. Here are a few things for future reference.

1. Deque should have the same structure when adding its first element, no matter addFirst/addLast.

2. Thing through before implementing. It's a lot more convenient to implement RandomizedQueue with resizing array instead of linked list.

3. Iterator is used to iterate through ALL elements of a set and is necessary to implement before using 'foreach'.

4. Read from command-line argument is different from reading from console... IDE also has a way to run a file similar to running from command-line.
