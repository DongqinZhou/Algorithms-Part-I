1. Pre-compute frequently-used values and store them in some variables.
2. Could hard code a little given that requirements are met.
3. Discussion forum and checklist are extremely helpful!
4. To compare self-defined variables, implement Comparable interface.
5. For a function that demands an interable return, use a variable that is iterable rather than implement it from scratch.
