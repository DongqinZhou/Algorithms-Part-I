# Algorithms: Part I

Keep in mind:

	1. Registering for a course is much better than listening to lectures on YouTube.
	2. Be sure to review the whole course after finishing it.	

Revisit CS 61A:

	1. Give a function exactly one job, but make it apply to many related situations.
	2. Don't repeat yourself (DRY). Implement once, execute many times.
	3. Discover similar patterns during computation. Implement this patterns just once, and use extra argument(s) for different scenarios.
	4. Functions can be used as arguments or return values. 
	5. Multi-assignment is particularly convenient.
	6. Recursion is pretty helpful but tricky to implement.
	7. Test-Driven Development: Develop incrementally and test each piece before moving on. Keep debugging!
	8. Object-oriented programming!!! Attributes, Methods, Inheritance etc.
	9. Mind deep copy and shallow copy.
