1. Recursion is difficult to implement. Be patient to debug it.
2. Use a minimal working example for debugging.
3. Mastered tree implementation and recursion.
4. Use private helper function. Don't know why but it looks elegant.
5. Do not be afraid of the freedom given by independent coding. If you need any variable, create it.
